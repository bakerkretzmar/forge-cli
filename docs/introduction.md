# Introduction

Forge CLI is the missing link between Laravel Forge and your local (and version controlled) PHP applications.

It allows you to keep server and site configurations under version control, and makes it easy to apply changes to your Forge provisioned server and sites.

```shell script
forge login

forge init

forge deploy
```
