# Installation

Forge CLI can be installed using composer.  
The easiest way to install Forge CLI is by making it a global composer dependency:

```bash
composer global require beyondcode/forge-cli
```

Now you're ready to go and can [login to Laravel Forge](/docs/forge-cli/getting-started/logging-in).
